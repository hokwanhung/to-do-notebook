# Version History
## Version 1.0
The original version, named version 1.0 is created by my classmate, which has identify the main structure of the whole monopoly game. 
However, some of the function, limited by the time constraint, still requires further modifications. And here is the point where I start handling the project.  
  
Things to do:  
  1. Modify the `GAME EDITOR` function to ensure the admin role is done
     - Ensure that even the `admin` panel is closed, the game would still continue.
     - Ensure that the `status` button is working fine.
  3. Modify the `TRADE` function to enable in-game trading
  4. Enlarge the `GUI` to fit in all information.
