# Version History
## Version 1.0
The original version, named version 1.0 is created by my classmate, which has identify the main structure of the whole monopoly game. 
However, some of the function, limited by the time constraint, still requires further modifications. And here is the point where I start handling the project.  
  
Things to do:  
  1. Modify the `GAME EDITOR` function to ensure the admin role is done
     - Ensure that even the `admin` panel is closed, the game would still continue.
     - Ensure that the `status` button is working fine.
  3. Modify the `TRADE` function to enable in-game trading
  4. Enlarge the `GUI` to fit in all information.

## Version 1.5
The modified version, point 1 and 2 is done at this point, but before risking modifying the GUI, I decided to call a save so it does not create any unnecessary yet complicated and time-consuming problems.  
  
Things to do: Enlarge the `GUI` to fit in all information.

## Version 2
Further modified version, there are much more hidden changes done in this one than the previous ones, and as the project is handed-in completely, this might be the last version for a while.  

| Achieved | Improvement |

| 1. Fixed the `Game Editor` bug in registering information. | 1. The GUI problem is currently unfixed as I asked my partner who designed the `GUI`. |
