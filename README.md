   1. detectInputType method
      - Detect input type and continuously requesting users until the correct type (integer) is given.
      - A detection of String "STOP" is included to exit the execution.
      - Returns a String instead of integer so as to fits with the detection of String "STOP".
      - The conversion of String to integer, as well as the stop of execution, relies on the main method (and the if-else statement inside).
      - The input of the method detectInput(String detectTarget) also request the user's input to be in a string form, though the user never knows.
